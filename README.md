- **SPF Record Scanning**: Identifies weak SPF policies and dangling includes  
- **DKIM Validation**: Checks for missing or weak DKIM keys
- **DMARC Assessment**: Evaluates DMARC policy strength and reporting configuration
- **High Performance**: Async/concurrent scanning with configurable thread pools
- **Multiple DNS Sources**: Uses multiple DNS resolvers + DNS-over-HTTPS for accuracy
- **Progress Tracking**: Optional progress bars for large domain lists
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed vulnerability analysis with actionable insights
